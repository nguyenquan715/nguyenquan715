## Overview

I have been a Web3 Security Researcher since August 2024, with a prior background as a software engineer. Currently, I primarily focus on auditing smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains. In addition, I'm able to review backend codebases for web applications written in Javascript and TypeScript. Below is a summary of my audit experience across three categories: private audits, bug bounty programs, and competitive audits.

## Private Audits

I was one of 40 security researchers selected to participate in the Pashov Audit Group internship program. During the program, each security researcher was randomly assigned to two private audits. Based on performance, teamwork, and communication skills, only a subset of researchers were selected to pass the program and become eligible for future private audits. 

I was one of the three researchers who successfully passed the program.

*(I use two nicknames: `Ragnarok` for public audits and `Shurikenzer` for private audits)*
